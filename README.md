# FIFA-CycleGAN
ðŸŽ® Turn FIFA 20 Gameplay into real life Football using a CycleGAN

In this project I attempt to transform frames of FIFA 20 gameplay into real life football broadcasts.
In order to do so we implement a CycleGAN in Keras according to the specifications of the original paper.
We train the CycleGAN on 1000 pictures of FIFA Gameplay and a Champions Leaue Broadcast of Barcelona vs. Liverpool.

This code saves all the models after each Epoch. Feel free to play around and adapt you this code to your problem.  
Don't hesitate to ask me if you have any questions!
